# The Empty Museum Survey Form
This is a survey form for a fictional museum. It was made as the second project for the Responsive Web Design Certification delivered by FreeCodeCamp.

The accessibility was a point of focus for me, so I tried to implement ARIA labels. The form is responsive, with an elegant design.

This project was built with:
- semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

And tested with:
- The web accessibility evaluation tool (WAVE)
- The Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA)
- The Markup Validation Service of W3C
